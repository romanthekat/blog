Well yeah, task 2 is even easier than the first, to my taste.

Current IntelliJ IDEA Nim lang plugin doesn't exactly work for me.
It correctly highlights the code, understands declarations - but it has no idea about stdlib, and has no autosuggestion.

Vim with plugin is more convenient as for now, but I like the idea of officially supported language plugin in such a popular tool - that could end up with something interesting
