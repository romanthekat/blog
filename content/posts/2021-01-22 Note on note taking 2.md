An interesting and predictable happens with note taking during scaling.
Once you have about 400+ notes 'plain' structure becomes not efficient. Seemingly it's become harder to keep the context of everything you are writing about. The whole idea of note writing  is to not trying to keep everything in your mind all the time.

That's the place where outlining works - it adds structure. There are numerous similar terms - outliners, structure notes, index notes, hubs. As for me I don't make any real difference between them. 
The idea is to create a summary note, like a table of contents in a book. It provides high-level perspective, links to related blocks of information.

This way you can group connected things in addition to interconnection between notes.
As a result you can create or restore a context about some particular topic faster. A book you are reading, some project at work or piece of tech you are familiarizing yourself.

Feels like with notes archive become larger, one eventually comes to 'hub of a hub' type of notes. Really high-level summary, main place about some particular type of information. 
In my case such a topic is 'programming' - all the computer science related notes can be traced down from here, though non-direcly, in a few hops from other index type notes.
Such amount or levels of structure fits nice.

Another userful thing is flagging the notes. Marking 'ongoing' context, currently needed notes. I do it with `flag` tag. 
So a combination of connection between releated notes, context/index notes, and marks for currently needed notes allows to keep everything you need in a few clicks away.

Besides that, an [article](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten) also mentiones an idea of 'double hash tags'. A sort of 'meta tag', similar to 'hub of a hubs', but in terms of tagging. 
Haven't yet used such a thing for myself, but will keep it in mind
