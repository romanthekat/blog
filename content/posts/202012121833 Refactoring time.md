For me it's always a pleasure to do some refactoring.
The whole idea is about re-structuring, creating more clear, poilshed, sane, understandable code structure.
More expressive, less obtrusive lines which just get the things done. In a more direct way.
Tearing a problem apart, re-assemble pieces, solve a puzzle.

Just like it
