title: "[1/100] 100 days to offload"

Recently I came across the https://100daystooffload.com
Simple idea - just write something, do it 100 times within the year.

Such a thoughts dump can actually be interesting, so I will give it a try.
On average that means 1 post each 3.5 days.
Just. Write.

For now at least it'll be in org-mode journal only.
Probably, if it turns out as something worth sharing, I'll switch to Hugo and deploy to my homepage.
