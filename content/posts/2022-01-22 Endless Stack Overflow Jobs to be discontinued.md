Well, recent [news](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/415293/sunsetting-jobs-developer-story) mean that [Stack Overflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) gonna be discontinued on March 31, 2022.

I liked this one. Kept looking from time to time what's interesting out there, how do vacancies look like.  
For me it had kinda intuitive interface. Lots of things on the page, but most of things I would need are just right there, ~1 click away. Pretty straightforward to my taste.  

I also gathered 'statistics' of opened vacances per languages. It's no way representative, but just as an example for myself "what's currently in look".  
Sadly, seems like overall data trend is decreasing jobs postings.
