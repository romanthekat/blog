It's been a while since I used Rust lang in any way or form.
I wouldn't say I've done anything noticable, or even useful it in, but still - kinda interested in this language, tons of little reasons.

As a sort of warm-up before [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2020 I would like to re-read [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) of Rust, take a closer look on 2018 edition of the language, and ideally try a few coding tasks using Rust specifically.
Language evolved, tooling have become more convenient than it was a couple of years ago - so it can be a really nice time for a revisit.
