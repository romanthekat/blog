Some notes can be quite a long write (see â„–2), and they simply won't be written just at once, in one sit.
That itself is ok, but causes concurrent posts creation to happen.
Maybe it's just lack of concentration, or probably just normal thing to be.

A minor second thought - seems like aggregating next ideas or themes to write about, possible optimization to the process - is a good thing to do.
Quite a few already saved, waiting for it's time
