Seems like I mostly finished the migration from Org-mode to a set of markdown files. 337 so far. That took a while. 
Also that was quite a mess. Removed tons of entries which aren't useful anymore.
Haven't migrated all the work/current project data yet, but didn't really need that - gonna migrate as per necessity arise.
I'm gonna keep the things this way, for a few months at least
